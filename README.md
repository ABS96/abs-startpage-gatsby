# ABS Startpage

This is my personal startpage, implemented in Gatsby.
It's pretty minimalistic.

## Usage

1. Download the contents of this repository and extract them to a folder
2. Open `src/data/sample-links.yaml`, customise it to your liking, and save it as `links.yaml` in the same directory
3. Build the project with `gatsby build`
4. In Chrome go to Extensions and add the `public` folder as an unpacked extension
